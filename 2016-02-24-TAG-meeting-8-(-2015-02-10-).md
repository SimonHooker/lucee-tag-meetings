**Meeting minutes**

1. **Approve meeting minutes from last meeting**

    * Meeting minutes from the TAG meeting 7 ([http://lang.lucee.org/t/tag-meeting-minutes-january-27th-2016-8pm-utc/276](http://lang.lucee.org/t/tag-meeting-minutes-january-27th-2016-8pm-utc/276)) approved with no objections 

2. **Discuss LAS response to direction on LuceeLang**

    * TAG discussed the response from LAS management board.

    * Further discussion about ACF-Lucee compatibility and where it should be acceptable to break compatibility

    * Until further notice, the TAG will discuss whether changes will be made to CFML

    * **Action:** Additional categorisation to be added to Jira to help make it clearer what aspect of Lucee is going to be affected by a change.

3. **Access Modifiers for variables**

    * [http://docs.lucee.org/guides/lucee-5/access-modifiers.html](http://docs.lucee.org/guides/lucee-5/access-modifiers.html)

    * Community expressed concerns that declaring a scoped variable as private or public makes no sense.

    * The precedent for this was set by functions which are also defined in the 'this' scope however have access modifiers implemented.

    * Opinion expressed that this is an ACF incompatiblity and something that is halfway towards Java.

    * 'private lastname' should create ‘variables.lastname’ but ‘private this.lastname’ should be a compiler error.  Similarly ‘public lastname’ could create ‘variables.lastname’.

    * There is already functionality that allows the default access modifier for the 'this' scope.

    * **Action: **Simon to create a ticket and add to the voting list for this meeting to decide on whether or not to remove this feature from Lucee 5.0

    * **Action: **Simon to create a ticket to discuss how to implement this feature ( this assumes a "Reject" vote on previous ticket )

4. **Review enhancement tickets**

    * *A selection of existing proposals and enhancements were selected for review during this TAG meeting.  Not all selected tickets were able to be discussed within the time allowed.*

    * **[LDEV-44**9](https://luceeserver.atlassian.net/browse/LDEV-449) - Redefining truthy and falsey values

        * **Discussion**

            * This change will allow handling where at present an illegal exception is shown.

            * The expected behavior will need careful documentation to ensure it is clear how it would function differently to ACF.

            * Potential for users to be able to override the default behavior to enable users to customise how data types are parsed when converted to boolean.  This option was met with criticism.

        * **Conclusion**

            * **Action** Subtasks to be raised for each data type and votes to be taken for each data type sub-task

            * **Vote taken** for each sub-type

                * **Null **- Accept ( 7 - 0 , 2 abstentions )

                * **Number** - Accept ( 6 - 0 , 3 abstentions )

                * **String ( "" throws error )** - Reject ( 6 - 0 , 3 abstentions )

                * **String ( "" returns false ) **- Accept ( 4 - 2 , 3 abstentions )

                * **Array** - Accept ( 6 - 0 , 3 abstentions )

                * **Struct** - Accept ( 6 - 0 , 3 abstentions )

                * **Object** - Accept ( 6 - 0 , 3 abstentions )

    * **[LDEV-63**2](https://luceeserver.atlassian.net/browse/LDEV-632) - Delete installed SSL certs within the UI

        * **Discussion**

            * This is not anything new to the language, just a new feature that should be added into the menu

        * **Conclusion**

            * **_Vote taken_** - Accept ( 9 - 0 )

    * **[LDEV-64**2](https://luceeserver.atlassian.net/browse/LDEV-642) - missing Array Splice function

        * **Discussion**

            * Concerns on similarity in name between slice() and splice()

            * The same functionality can be achieved using the existing functions, splice() as part of the core could be seen as superfulous

            * Just because other languages have a function doesn't mean Lucee needs to have the exact same function

        * **Conclusion**

            * **_Vote taken_** - Reject ( 7 - 2 )

    * **[LDEV-68**9](https://luceeserver.atlassian.net/browse/LDEV-689) - New function structImmerse()

        * **Discussion**

            * Concern about how sub-array elements would be handled

            * Generally seen as something that should be achieved with a user defined function rather than a part of the general language

        * **Conclusion**

            * **_Vote taken_** - Reject ( 7 - 2 )

    * **[LDEV-69**8](https://luceeserver.atlassian.net/browse/LDEV-698) - Make retry settings for email sending configurable

        * **Discussion**

            * This ticket is for a new attribute on the cfmail tag

            * A precedent for this logic exists in cfthread

        * **Conclusion**

            * **_Vote taken_** - Accept ( 9 - 0 )

    * **[LDEV-70**9](https://luceeserver.atlassian.net/browse/LDEV-709) - struct.clone() does not reliably preserve types of cloned child fields

        * **Discussion**

            * This ticket appears to be more of a bug

            * Dev explained how the clone function behaves and why this is a problem.

            * There is not a simple fix for this

            * Similar to the functionality requested in LDEV-689 but different in that an exact copy is desired rather than having any concern about how to handle key conflicts

            * Option 4, calling clone only if "deepCopy" is set to true, suggested as a solution and put to a vote.

        * **Conclusion**

            * **_Vote taken_** - Accept ( 9 - 0 )

            * **Action: **Documentation to be updated to more clearly communicate the behavior of cloning

    * **[LDEV-71**5](https://luceeserver.atlassian.net/browse/LDEV-715) - Ability to create a Cache Connection from Application.cfc

        * **Discussion**

            * Certain settings can't be applied to the Application.cfc due to chicken-and-egg issues.  Application.cfc can only cover runtime behavior.

            * Opinion in favour of allowing every runtime setting be able to be configured in the Application.cfc

        * **Conclusion**

            * **_Vote taken_** - Accept ( 9 - 0 )

            * **Action: **Create a matrix of features in the admin that could be exposed as configurable into the Application.cfc

    * **[LDEV-4**2](https://luceeserver.atlassian.net/browse/LDEV-42) - Array methods: shift(), unshift(), push(), pop(), splice()

        * **Discussion**

            * Similar sentiment to LDEV-642 in that most of this functionality is available using existing functionality

            * Reluctance to add in a lot more array functions

            * Parallels drawn between how PHP has many functions that fundamentally perform the same functionality

            * This could be created as an extension

        * **Conclusion**

            * **_Vote taken_** - Reject ( 5 - 4 )

    * **[LDEV-72**0](https://luceeserver.atlassian.net/browse/LDEV-720) - Allow Negative Index for ListDeleteAt and ArrayDeleteAt

        * **Discussion**

            * Intended to remove the reliance on having to retrieve list/array length in order to remove the last element.

            * Some opinion against implementing on lists however support for implementing on both list and array for consistency

            * Strong opinion against "last" as a magic word, support for numeric arguments only

        * **Conclusion**

            * **_Vote taken_** - Accept ( 9 - 0 )

            * **Action: **Add a ticket to allow discussion of making Left/Right(0) return an empty string.

    * **[LDEV-53**0](https://luceeserver.atlassian.net/browse/LDEV-530) - Enhance CFIMAP Tag

        * **Discussion**

            * This ticket is mostly about improving parity with ACF, so more of a compatibility issue.

            * Opinion in favour of moving cfimap into an extension.

            * Some opinions that the ACF implementation is not perfect

        * **Conclusion**

            * **_Vote taken_** - Accept ( 5 - 4 )
